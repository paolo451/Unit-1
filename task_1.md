## Homework

#### Question 1: Do you think it is necessary to involve the shop owner during the process along the three weeks? Or alternatively, is it better to involve him only when the product is finished? Explain your answer

I think that it is fundamental to involve the shop owner during the process, all during the 3 weeks. We want to deliver a product which satisfies the needs of the customer, and that is our primary goal. Therefore, hearing their feedback and if they are satisfied with the product as it goes, not only puts on a better path the development process, but also, allows us to have an efficient time use in order to not waste time in a solution that will not be liked by the client. In the opposite case, if we only told the client about the our solution when it's finished, we are at the risk of just then noticing that there are substancial flaws in the product, or even that the client doesn't like it at all, and then we have to do it all over again.

#### Question 2: Do you think it is necessary to create MVPs for your game? If so, what would some of the MPV look like and what do you expect to obtain from the client?

I think that, as this is a short project, we would probably need some very very basic MVPs. I think that a basic game showing the proposed dynamics (lose and get life, take decisions, tell the story) would satisfy it. My main expectation from the client would be constructive and precise feedback. With that, I think that I have more than enough.

#### Question 3: Do you see similarities between the Human-Centered Design cycle presented in the video and the Design Cycle we use for developing software? Explain.

Yes, indeed they are very similar. Both look for the utmost improvement of the process in order to accomplish efficiency and satisfaction from the user - or person, as Don Norman precises. This kind of iterative processes are pretty much equal, if not entirely the same. With both, we get great results, and the best possible version of something.

#### Question 4: What are the simple principles for human-centered design presented in the video? Write a sentence with the definition of each.

First, **Discoverability**, which means that as soon as we see it, we inherently understand how to use it. Then, **Feedback**, which means that we get a response after we have done certain thing, so we understand what just happened, or that something happened at all.

#### Question 5. Consider your game. Think about ways you can improve the Playersâ€™ Experience using Human-centered design. Write below your ideas:

I think that my controls are pretty intuitive, but I could rephrase some instructions or have some space of experimentation so the user gets used to them. Moreover, I will have a textual response as soon as the player does anything, so they are aware that they took a decision, and how it impacted their game.
