# Lesson 1
### This is an awful drawing from a computer

This is the drawing I did the 24 of August of 2021 (on Peru, because on Japan it's already 25)

This are the internal circuits of a computer. Not really a computer expert. Not an artist either.

## Homework 

#### What are variables in computer programming? What types of variables can we use in Python?

Variables in computer programming are codenames for certain places in memory where we can store a single value. We can save information for later on reference it with just the variable. (Sweigart, 2015). The type of variables in Python will automatically accommodate the different data types that we have, being these 5, which are: Numbers (int, float, long and complex), Strings, Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries (Fugier, 2018).

#### What are the four CTS?
The four Computational Thinking Skills are first, Decomposition, which means breaking the whole process into smaller and more manageable parts. Then, Pattern Recognition, which is looking at those pieces and seeing what trends and patterns one can identify. After that, Abstraction, which is generalizing and getting to understand what generates such patterns and how we can approach them. Finally, Automation by Algorithms, which means developing step-by-step instructions so someone else can do the same on an easier way. (Harimurti et al, 2019)
