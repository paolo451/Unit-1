## Reflection

**Q1: What are the steps in the design cycle?**

The steps are: 

 1st - Planning

2nd - Designing

3rd - Development

4th - Evalutation

5th - Implementation

**Q2: What is the purpose of the success criteria?**

The purpose is for us to delimit the boundaries and establish where we are accomplishing the things required by the client. 
This way, we are able to make sure we're succesfully achieving the requirements of the game.

**Q3: What do you understand now about Computer Science/computers that you did not before U1?**

I now comprehend that Computer Science involves a whole process of development and designing that goes beyond just having "good code".
It also implies having a thought process behind it, specifications of how you're doing it and making sure that you're designing a project that
can be understood by others in the future. 

**Q4: What do you understand now about yourself that that you did not before Unit 1?**

I now understand that my approach to solve problems or projects is layerized, in the sense that first I will take a lot of time to set the very
basic functions and fundamental mechanics from the game, but starting from that, and going to the superficial layers of the game, I will take
less and less time. Being so, that if at the beginning it seems that I'm taking too much time, at the end it turns out that I ended up before I expected.

**Q5: What worked well for you during the development of Unit 1?**
The approach I took to develop the product was useful for me, because it kept me in schedule. I think that something important and useful for me was
taking my time in some moments and if feeling kind of burned out and without any ideas, just let my mind rest for a couple of days and
not think more about it,

**Q6: What did not work well for you during the development of Unit 1?**
To code on "all-nighters" worked well for me, however on terms of time management, even if it was effective, I felt like there were days where I didn't
get any sleep. 

**Q8: A developer is only responsible for the accomplishment of the success criteria. Do you agree or disagree? Defend your answer.**
The developer is only directly responsable for the sucess criteria, however, in terms of perhaps kind of a moral duty towards fellow
developers, one is also responsible to deliver an understandable and mantainable code which can be read and worked on by other developers and 
people involved in the project.
